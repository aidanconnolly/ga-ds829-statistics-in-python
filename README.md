## Learning Objectives
- **Compute** dot products, matrix multiplications, and vector norms by hand and using NumPy.
- **Code** summary statistics using NumPy and Pandas: mean, median, mode, max, min, quartile, inter-quartile range, variance, standard deviation, and correlation.
- **Create** basic data visualizations - including: scatter plots, box plots, and histograms.
- **Describe** characteristics and trends in a dataset using visualizations.
- **Describe** the bias and variance of statistical estimators.
- **Identify** a normal distribution within a dataset using summary statistics and data visualizations.
